# Senior Sphere

Senior Sphere was developed as an entry for the Hacktech Hackathon organized by PCCE College. This project aims to create a website tailored for elderly individuals, fostering connections and providing safety measures through innovative features.

## Overview

Senior Sphere is a web platform designed specifically for the elderly population. The primary focus is on facilitating connections and ensuring safety through advanced functionalities.

### Features

- **Fall Detection:**
  - Utilizes Bluetooth watches to monitor heartbeat data.
  - Automatically alerts emergency services if abnormal heart rates are detected or if the heartbeat surpasses specified parameters.
  - Emergency contacts stored in the dedicated section for immediate assistance.

- **Announcement Section:**
  - Enables users to stay updated with news and relevant announcements.
  - Provides a centralized place for important information that caters to the elderly community.

## How It Works

The website utilizes Bluetooth-enabled watches to gather real-time heartbeat data from users. The fall detection feature constantly monitors this data, and if any irregularities or predefined alarming heart rates are detected, it triggers an immediate message to emergency services along with the stored emergency contacts.

The announcement section serves as a channel to broadcast news and updates crucial for the elderly, ensuring they stay informed and connected.
